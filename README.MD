# Tokenizer and Recursive Descent Parser

## Overview

This program was created as part of the Programming Languages Course during the Spring Semester of 2023. It serves as both a tokenizer and a recursive descent parser. The program's purpose is to take in tokens from the lexical analyzer assignment output file and parse the program to determine if it is syntactically correct.

### Usage

1. Enter the name of the file that contains the tokens. Ensure that the token file is located in the same folder as the program.
2. The input file should consist of a list of tokens with a newline between each individual token.
3. The program will output whether the input tokens are successfully parsed or not, and it will report any failures or errors that occur during parsing.

### Grammar Rules

Please note that the original grammar rules `ENCODE_FORMAT_TYPE` and `LINE_FORMAT_TYPE` have been transformed to fix disjointment and ensure that the program is in the appropriate format for a recursive descent parser.

Additionally, on 4/24, the grammar rules `ENCODE_FILE`, `NAME`, and `OUTPUT_FILE` were updated to simplify the original grammar rules.
